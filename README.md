# The Loony Quiz
Welcome to our small project, created by Josh and Hannah. In this project we have produced a simple quiz game, where the user selects between two topics before being presented with a question from that chosen topic.

There are, currently, four topics to choose from with a total of three questions in each. We are, however, planning to expand our question and topic range once we have a prototype we are happy with.
